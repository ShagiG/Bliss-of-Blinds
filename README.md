# Bliss-of-Blinds
Blindness is lack of visual sight due to physiological or neurological factors. In our proposed project, a simple, cheap, 
user friendly, device will be designed and implemented to improve the mobility and serene of visually impaired and blind people. 
The device possesses set of ultrasonic sensors for detecting the obstacles around the surrounding, a raspberry-pi zero kit
to pursue the data from the sensor data to communicate the status and issue commands for navigating and also a google assistant
which can help the user at any time needed and also this device can help the user in his life identifying objects also.
This concept is cheap, fast and easy to use and an innovative solution for the blind and visually impaired people.
